The objective of this script is to diagnose the infrared opacity of Titan's atmosphere. We will use a mix of nitrogen and methane. 

The saturation mixing ratio of methane at the tropopause is 0.017 (Griffith et al. 2011).

Surface pressure of 1.5 atm. Infrared opacity is mostly due to CIA of N2, CH4, and H2.
Hazes are mostly transparent in the thermal infrared (Fig 1 from McKay 1991), so can be neglected from our analysis.
The mixing ratio of H2 is about 0.3% on Titan, and the mixing ratio of CH4 is a few percent (McKay 1991).
The window region on Titan is 400-600 cm-1, and most of the opacity is at lower wavenumbers than this due to N2 and CH4. 
Unlike CO2 on Earth, the production of H2 on Titan is controlled by photochemistry. 
Opacity of CH4-N2 scales as CH4, but opacity of CH4-CH4 scales as (CH4)^2, so this means that in a warmer climate, the opacity of 
CH4-CH4 could dominate over CH4-N2 between 200-400 cm-1, which should be taken into account for warmer simulations of Titan. 
The rule-of-thumb is that 3 times higher concentration of CH4 than present-day would faciliate this transition in major source
of infrared opacity at wavenumbers slightly less than the window region. 

We will want to include the following infrared sources of opacity:
(1) N2 
(2) CH4
(3) H2
and the following sources of collision-induced absorption (over certain temp range): 
(1) N2-N2  (70-200 K, for 0-450 cm-1)
(2) N2-CH4 (40-400 K)
(3) N2-H2   (40-400 K)
(4) CH4-CH4 (optional at Ts<94 K)
We may be able to avoid (4)-CIA if we only consider surface temperatures less than the present-day value.
Lack of CIA for N2-N2 at wavenumbers greater than 450 cm-1 is not an issue because N2-N2 is negligible there. 
In any case, we would expect a transition to steady precipitation at these temperatures. 

Of these gases, the CTM absorption is available only for N2. 

The tropospheric lapse rate is <1 K/km (McKay et al. 1997), with the dry adiabatic lapse rate approximately 1.3 K/km. 
Note that the tropopause is at 40km, so for a surface temperature of 94 K,the lapse rate must be <1. 
    
Planning the experiments needed, we need a case with (optical depth of)
(1) N2-N2 only 
(2) N2-CH4 only
(3) N2-H2 only
(4) CH4-CH4 only
(5) Every combination of (1)-(4)
